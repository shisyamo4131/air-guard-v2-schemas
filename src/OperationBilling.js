 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Extends OperationResult class to represent the billing of an operation.
 * - This class provides the same functionality as OperationResult but with a different semantic meaning
 *   focused on billing operations rather than general operation results.
 * - All properties, computed values, and methods are inherited from OperationResult.
 * - The `className` is set to "稼働請求" (Operation Billing) to distinguish it from OperationResult.
 * - The `create` method is overridden to indicate that creation of OperationBilling instances
 *   is not implemented, as billing records are typically generated through the OperationResult class.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * @inherited - The following properties are inherited from OperationResult:
 * @props {string|null} siteOperationScheduleId - Associated SiteOperationSchedule document ID

 * @props {boolean} useAdjustedQuantity - Flag to indicate if adjusted quantities are used for billing
 * @props {number} adjustedQuantityBase - Adjusted quantity for base workers
 * - Quantity used for billing base workers when `useAdjustedQuantity` is true.
